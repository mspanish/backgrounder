This is a work in progress, I still haven't converted the triangles or lines to SVG.js. Also, I write JSON every time the user updates the design, but I don't have a system for loading or saving the JSON to DB yet.

Converted to SVG.js, with features like gradients, different shapes, and more added.

The original Codepen this project is based on can be found here - it draws the circles in a different, overlapping fashion - and can be used to generate some really [cool patterns:] (http://codepen.io/mspanish/pen/WOmgQr). You can also check out the Dudley Storey's [blog post about this here](http://thenewcode.com/336/Dynamic-SVG-Background-Pattern-Maker).
